## Alternative: Fix SSH and Use Terminal

If you prefer command line, here's the safe fix:

### Run in PowerShell:
```powershell
# Remove old host key
ssh-keygen -R 148.230.96.155

# Upload file
cd "C:\Users\BuildWatch\Downloads\Build Watch"
scp buildwatch_lgu_FRESH_export.sql root@148.230.96.155:/root/
```

**This is 100% safe!** It only fixes the SSH connection and uploads a file.
