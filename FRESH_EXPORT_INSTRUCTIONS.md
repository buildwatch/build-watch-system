# EXPORT FRESH DATABASE - Updated Instructions

## You're Right - We Need a FRESH Export!

The old `buildwatch_lgu_database.sql` is from July 21 - we need a current one!

## EXPORT NOW FROM MYSQL WORKBENCH:

### In MySQL Workbench:

1. **Make sure Server > Data Export window is still open**
   - You should see "29 tables selected"
   - Export Options on the right side

2. **For the "Export to Self-Contained File" option:**
   - Click the **"..."** button next to it
   - Navigate to: `C:\Users\BuildWatch\Downloads\Build Watch\`
   - **Type this as filename:** `buildwatch_lgu_FRESH_export.sql`
   - Click **"Save"**
   - This will update the path in the export window

3. **Click "Start Export" button**
   - Wait for it to finish (1-2 minutes)
   - Look for "Successfully exported" message

4. **Check the file was created:**
   - Go to your Windows Explorer
   - Navigate to: `C:\Users\BuildWatch\Downloads\Build Watch\`
   - Look for: `buildwatch_lgu_FRESH_export.sql`
   - Check its size - should be recent (today's date)

## OR TRY THIS ALTERNATIVE:

### If you closed the export window:

1. Click **"Server"** menu â†’ **"Data Export"**
2. Check **"buildwatch_lgu"** database
3. Select **"Export to Self-Contained File"**
4. Click **"..."** to choose location
5. Save as: `buildwatch_lgu_FRESH_export.sql`
6. Click **"Start Export"**
