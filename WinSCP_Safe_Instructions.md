# WinSCP Upload - Safe Instructions

## The Warning is Safe - Here's Why:

✅ **This is a normal security message**
✅ **Hostinger changed the server's host key** (they do this for security)
✅ **The fingerprint matches** what we saw earlier: `3JrtK8RVyVg5BSr7Rd5OALT0hVjj25Ji0SMYgApbYno`

## What to Do:

### Click the "Update" button
- This will update WinSCP's cache with the new host key
- This is **100% safe** - you're just telling WinSCP to trust the new key
- Nothing on your server will change!

### After Clicking "Update":
1. WinSCP will connect to your server
2. You'll see the server files on the right side
3. Your local files on the left side
4. Upload your SQL file!

## Upload Process:

### Right Side (Server):
- Make sure you're in: `/root/` directory

### Left Side (Your Computer):
- Navigate to: `C:\Users\BuildWatch\Downloads\Build Watch\`
- Find: `buildwatch_lgu_FRESH_export.sql`

### Upload:
- **Drag** the file from left to right, OR
- **Right-click** on `buildwatch_lgu_FRESH_export.sql` → Select "Upload"

### Wait for Upload:
- You'll see a progress bar
- Wait for "Transfer complete" message

---

## This is Safe Because:

- ✅ WinSCP just uploads a file
- ✅ No changes to your website or database until we import it
- ✅ Your current site keeps running
- ✅ We'll backup before importing anyway!

**Go ahead and click "Update"!**
