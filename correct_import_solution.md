# Correct Solution for Importing Database

## The Problem

Your previous commands had issues:

1. **First attempt** (`sed -i 's/CONSTRAINT .* FOREIGN KEY .* REFERENCES.*;//'`): 
   - Error 3780: Foreign key constraint incompatible (data types don't match)
   
2. **Second attempt** (`grep -v "FOREIGN KEY"`):
   - Error 1064: SQL syntax error - leaves dangling commas before closing parentheses

## Why These Errors Happened

Looking at your SQL file structure (lines 48-51):
```sql
  KEY `idx_activity_logs_user_action` (`userId`,`action`),
  KEY `idx_activity_logs_user_date` (`userId`,`createdAt`),
  CONSTRAINT `activity_logs_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`userId`) REFERENCES `users` (`id`) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

When you remove the CONSTRAINT line (line 50), line 49 still has a trailing comma, which causes syntax error.

## The Correct Solution

Run these commands **on your server**:

```bash
cd /root

# Step 1: Remove CONSTRAINT lines that contain FOREIGN KEY
awk '!/CONSTRAINT.*FOREIGN KEY/' buildwatch_lgu_FRESH_export.sql > temp_clean.sql

# Step 2: Remove trailing commas that come before closing parentheses
# This handles the case: ")," becomes ")"
sed -i ':a;N;$!ba;s/,\n\s*)/\n)/g' temp_clean.sql

# Step 3: Import the cleaned file
mysql -u root -p buildwatch_lgu < temp_clean.sql
```

## Alternative Simpler Solution

If the above still has issues, use this perl one-liner that does it all in one step:

```bash
cd /root

perl -i.backup -0pe 's/,?\s*\n\s*CONSTRAINT[^\n]*FOREIGN KEY[^\n]*\n//g' buildwatch_lgu_FRESH_export.sql

# Then import
mysql -u root -p buildwatch_lgu < buildwatch_lgu_FRESH_export.sql
```

## What Each Part Does

- `-0` : Treat file as single string (allows multi-line matching)
- `pe` : Print each line after processing
- `s/,?\s*\n\s*CONSTRAINT[^\n]*FOREIGN KEY[^\n]*\n//g` : 
  - Finds comma (optional), whitespace, newline, CONSTRAINT...FOREIGN KEY...newline
  - Removes the entire match including the comma before it
  - `g` flag makes it global (all occurrences)

## To Answer Your Original Question

**No, these results are NOT correct.** You need to fix the trailing comma issue.
