## üöß Current Status

### ‚úÖ Ready for Production
- **Frontend**: Complete with real API integration
- **Backend**: Complete with database integration
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role validation
- **API Services**: All endpoints functional
- **Database Schema**: Complete with sample data

### üîÑ Database Initialization
- **Issue**: Sequelize sync hanging during table creation
- **Workaround**: Manual SQL schema provided (`backend/sql/schema.sql`)
- **Solution**: Use `npm run manual-init` to create tables manually

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **‚úÖ Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Try automated sync
   npm run init-db
   
   # Option 2: Manual setup (recommended)
   npm run manual-init
   ```

2. **‚úÖ Test Backend API**
   ```bash
   npm run test-api
   ```

3. **‚úÖ Start Backend Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **‚úÖ Test Frontend Integration**
   - Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm start`
   - Test login with sample credentials
   - Verify dashboard access

### Short Term (Next 1-2 Days)
1. **Database Troubleshooting**
   - Resolve Sequelize sync issues
   - Optimize database performance
   - Add database migrations

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - File upload functionality
   - Real-time notifications
   - Advanced reporting
   - Email integration

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Unit tests for API endpoints
   - Integration tests
   - User acceptance testing
   - Performance testing

### Medium Term (Next Week)
1. **Production Deployment**
   - Environment configuration
   - SSL certificate setup
   - Database backup strategy
   - Monitoring and logging

2. **User Training**
   - Documentation creation
   - Training materials
   - User guides per role

## üìä Sample Data Available

### Users (All roles with sample credentials)
- **System Admin**: `sysadmin` / `password123`
- **LGU-PMT**: `juan.pmt` / `password123`
- **EIU**: `maria.eiu` / `password123`
- **LGU-IU**: `pedro.iu` / `password123`
