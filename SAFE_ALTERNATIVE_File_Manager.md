# SAFE ALTERNATIVE: Use Hostinger File Manager

## ✅ This is 100% Safe - No Server Changes

### Using the Hostinger Panel File Manager:

1. **In the Hostinger VPS Panel** (where you're viewing "Overview")
   - Look at the **left sidebar**
   - Click on **"OS & Panel"** 
   - You should see a submenu appear

2. **Find "File Manager" or "Files"**
   - Click on it

3. **Navigate to /root/**
   - In the file manager, navigate to the `/root/` directory

4. **Click "Upload" button**
   - You'll see an upload interface

5. **Select your file**
   - Browse to: `C:\Users\BuildWatch\Downloads\Build Watch\buildwatch_lgu_FRESH_export.sql`
   - Click "Upload"

6. **Wait for upload to complete**

## Why This Is Safe:

- ✅ Just uploading a file to your server
- ✅ No commands being executed
- ✅ File just sits there until we import it
- ✅ Your website keeps running normally
- ✅ All your current data stays intact

---

## After Upload:

Once the file is uploaded, let me know and I'll give you the commands to **backup** your current database and then **import** this new one.

Even the import process is safe because we'll **backup first**!
